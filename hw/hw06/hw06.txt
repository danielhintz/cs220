1. Given the following code, and assuming short ints are 16 bits wide, and ints are 32 bits wide:
 
 	short int x=-5;
 	int y;
 	y=x;
 	
    a. What is the value of y in decimal? -5
    b. What are the values of y and y in hexadecimal? -5, 0xfffffffb
    c. Does padding on the left with the sign bit to increase precision change the value of a negative number? no
   	
    	
2. Given the following code, and assuming ints are 32 bits wide:
	int x=0x00000011;
	int y=0xFFFFFFFC;
	
	a. What is the hexadecimal value of x+y? 0xd
	b. What is the decimal value of x, and y? 17, -4
	c. What is the decimal value of (x+y)? 13
	d. Do you get the same answer for (x+y) using either hexadecimal arithmetic, or decimal? yes
    	
    	
  3. Given the following code:
  	
  	int x=atoi(argv[1]);
  	int y=atoi(argv[2]);
  	unsigned int v=x;
  	unsigned int w=y;
  	int s_sum=x+y;
  	usinged int u_sum=v+w;
  	if (s_sum==u_sum) printf("Unsigned and signed are the same\n");
  	else printf("Unsigned and signed are different\n");
  	
     a. What do you expect to see printed for most values of argv[1] and argv[2]? Unsigned and signed are the same
     
     b. Are there any values of argv[1] and argv[2] which will result in "Unsigned and signed are different"? I do not think so
     
     c. If you changed the addition to multiplication: "s_sum=x*y;" and "u_sum=v*w;" will you get the same results? Yes
     
4. Given the following C code:

	int x=atoi(argv[1]);
	int y=(x | (-1-x));
	if (y==-1) printf("How did you know that?\n");
	else printf("Special value of x!\n");
	
   Is there any value of x for which will print "Special value of x!"?
   If so, what is the value of x? No
      
5. Given the following code:

	constant float big=1e20;
	constant float little=-1e20;
	constant float pi=3.14;
	float y = (big + little)+pi;
	float z = big + (little + pi);
	if (y==z) printf("This is an example of the associative property.\n");
	else printf("This is a counter-example.. the associative property does not hold!\n");
	
   Which message will get printed?  Counter-example
   Why?  Floating point arithmetic rounds (little+pi) and it ends up removing the pi, which is counter-intuitive because addition should be associative but because floating point numbers are stupid it isn't
