1. Given the following code:
   int x = -5;
   int y = x/2;
   int z = x>>1;

   a. Will "y" and "z" have the same value?  If so, why? If not, why not?

   b. Is the statement "shifting to the right is the same as dividing by two" correct?

2. Given the following C code (where %p in printf means print the hexadecimal value of a pointer):

   int vec[4]={6,7,8,9};
       int * vecptr=vec;
       	   printf("Vector is at %p\n",vecptr);
	   		  printf("vec[2] is at %p\n",vecptr+2);
			  		 printf("vec[2] is not at %p\n", (char *)vecptr+2);

   If the first printf statement results in "Vector is at 0x5fcb00",

      a) What will the second printf statement print?

      b) What will the third printf statement print?

3. What are the three ways we have discussed in class to determine the x86 assembler instructions generated by
   compiling a C program?

4. If you are on a little-endian machine that uses 32 bit integers, define a "palindromic" number as a number
   for which x==htonl(x). Is 16,843,009 a "palindromic" number?  Why or why not?

5. The standard library function "float powf(float a,float b)" returns the value of "a" to the power of "b".
   For instance, powf(2.0,3.0) return 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 = 8.0.  Find an integer value for "exp" for which the
      FRAC bits of the expression "powf(2.0,exp)" is non-zero. (Warning: the representation of INFINITY in floating
         point has zero FRAC bits.)
